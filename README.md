# Monte Carlo Pi
Xian is here!This is just a simple webapp that calculates Pi by using Monte Carlo integration
to find the area of the unit circle, and calculating the ratio of the circle's
area to that of the smallest square containing it.

The calculations are done in the file `main.js`. There is a little web
application, with graphics generated from `charts.js` and the html in
`index.html`.

## Setup
To setup the web application, a few things need to be intalled. In the main
directory,

1. Install Bootstrap and jQuery using bower: `bower install bootstrap`
2. Install D3 using npm: `npm install d3`.
